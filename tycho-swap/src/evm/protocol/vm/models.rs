/// Represents a distinct functionality or feature that an `EVMPoolState` can support.
///
/// Each `Capability` variant corresponds to a specific functionality that influences how the
/// simulation interacts with the `EVMPoolState`.
///
/// # Variants
///
/// - `SellSide`: Supports swapping with a fixed sell amount.
/// - `BuySide`: Supports swapping with a fixed buy amount.
/// - `PriceFunction`: Supports evaluating dynamic pricing based on a function.
/// - `FeeOnTransfer`: Support tokens that charge a fee on transfer.
/// - `ConstantPrice`: The pool does not suffer from price impact and maintains a constant price for
///   increasingly larger specified amounts.
/// - `TokenBalanceIndependent`:Indicates that the pool does not read its own token balances from
///   token contracts while swapping.
/// - `ScaledPrice`: Indicates that prices are returned scaled, else it is assumed prices still
///   require scaling by token decimals.
/// - `HardLimits`: Indicates that if we try to go over the sell limits, the pool will revert.
/// - `MarginalPrice`: Indicates whether the pool's price function can be called with amountIn=0 to
///   return the current price
